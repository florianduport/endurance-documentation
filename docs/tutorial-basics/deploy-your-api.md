# Deploy your API

Deploying your API is easy. To run the application in production mode use: 

```
npm run prod
```

If you're using the Dockerfile, just change the command to use the same npm command. 

## Isolating and scaling

Endurance makes it easy to isolate a specific module into a new Endurance installation. It makes it convenient to perform structural evolution of your API through time without compromising the codebase.
